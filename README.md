This is a Basic game i have been working on. it uses html css and js mainly to make it so that it looks like the car is moving through the traffic. Try to avoid the incoming cars as it could slow you down.
And also dont go in the sand as it will also slow you.
after the given time if you can pass through the finish line, YOU WIN!!!
try to beat it as soon as possible i hope you enjoy it! :)
(note: there is no need to install anything it is web based so just open the website and start playing!)
